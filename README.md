# Tron – Real-Time Fraud Prevention Prototype

This project is a hackathon prototype for detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions
before they are completed.

## Core Idea
- Build a behavioral profile for each user
- Score incoming transactions in real time
- Apply risk-based decisions:
  - Auto-approve
  - Require OTP verification
  - Block suspicious transactions

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (later for ML-based risk scoring)

## Status
Day 1: Project setup and dependency management completed.
